1.Using the function strcar(str1, str2) we can concatenate two strings. It  deletes the \0 from the first string and merges two strings

2. I think it will be 0 because it is undeclared.

3.You need two integers which when multiplied equals 64 so like int a[8][8];or int a [4][16

4.A. strcmp() Compares two strings, if they are identical it becomes true, if they are not it becomes false.

4.B. fgets() It is scanf for strings, scans the string input. It scans  the \n at the end. That needs to be changed to \0.

4.C. strcat() Concatenates two strings. It deletes the \0 from the first    string.

4.D. strlen() Tells us the length of the string. Sum of all letters and     spaces.
